.# Abstract

Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting, and Conformance
(DMARC) is a scalable mechanism by which a Domain Owner can request
feedback about email messages using their domain in the From: address
field.  This document describes "failure reports," or "failed message
reports", which provide details about individual messages that failed
to authenticate according to the DMARC mechanism.

# Introduction {#introduction}

RFC EDITOR: PLEASE REMOVE THE FOLLOWING PARAGRAPH BEFORE PUBLISHING:
The source for this draft is maintained in GitHub at:
https://github.com/ietf-wg-dmarc/draft-ietf-dmarc-failure-reporting

Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting, and Conformance
(DMARC) [@!I-D.ietf-dmarc-dmarcbis] is a scalable mechanism by which a
mail-originating organization can express domain-level policies and
preferences for message validation, disposition, and reporting, that a
mail-receiving organization can use to improve mail handling. This
document focuses on one type of reporting that can be requested under
DMARC.

Failure reports provide detailed information about the failure of a single
message or a group of similar messages failing for the same reason. They
are meant to aid in cases where a Domain Owner is unable to detect why
failures reported in aggregate form did occur. It is important to note
these reports can contain either the header or the entire content of a
failed message, which in turn may contain personally identifiable
information, which should be considered when deciding whether to
generate such reports.

## Terminology {#terminology}

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL
NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED",
"MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as
described in BCP 14 [@!RFC2119] [@!RFC8174] when, and only when, they
appear in all capitals, as shown here.


# DMARC Failure Reports {#failure-reports}

Besides the header or the entire content of a failed message, failure 
reports supply details about transmission and DMARC authentication, 
which may aid the Domain Owner in determining failure causes.

Failure reports are normally generated and sent almost immediately
after the Mail Receiver detects a DMARC failure.  Rather than waiting
for an aggregate report, these reports are useful for quickly
notifying the Domain Owners when there is an authentication failure.
Whether the failure is due to an infrastructure problem or the
message is inauthentic, failure reports also provide more information
about the failed message than is available in an aggregate report.

These reports should include as much of the message header and body as
possible, consistent with the reporting party's privacy policies, to
enable the Domain Owner to diagnose the authentication failure.

When a Domain Owner requests failure reports for the purpose of
forensic analysis, and the Mail Receiver is willing to provide such
reports, the Mail Receiver generates and sends a message using the
format described in [@!RFC6591]; this document updates that reporting
format, as described in (#reporting-format-update).

The destination(s) and nature of the reports are defined by the "ruf"
and "fo" tags as defined in [@!I-D.ietf-dmarc-dmarcbis, section 5.3].

Where multiple URIs are selected to receive failure reports, the
report generator **MUST** make an attempt to deliver to each of them.
External destinations **MUST** be verified, see (#verifying-external-destinations).
Report generators **MUST NOT** consider "ruf" tags in DMARC Policy Records having a "psd=y"
tag, unless there are specific agreements between the interested parties.

An obvious consideration is the denial-of-service attack that can be
perpetrated by an attacker who sends numerous messages purporting to
be from the intended victim Domain Owner but that fail both SPF and
DKIM; this would cause participating Mail Receivers to send failure
reports to the Domain Owner or its delegate in potentially huge
volumes.
Accordingly, participating Mail Receivers are encouraged to
aggregate these reports as much as is practical, using the Incidents
field of the Abuse Reporting Format [@!RFC5965].
Indeed, the aim is not to count each and every failure, but rather to
report different failure paths.
Various pruning techniques are possible, including the following:

* store reports for a period of time before sending them, allowing
detection, collection, and reporting of like incidents;

* apply rate limiting, such as a maximum number of reports per
minute that will be generated (and the remainder discarded);

# Other Failure Reports {#other-reports}

This document only describes DMARC failure reports.  DKIM failure
reports [@RFC6651] and SPF failure reports [@RFC6652] are described
in their own documents.  A Report Generator issuing a DMARC failure
report may or may not simultaneously issue also a failure report specific
to the failed authentication mechanism, according to its policy.

# Reporting Format Update {#reporting-format-update}

Operators implementing this specification also implement an augmented
version of [@!RFC6591] as follows:

1. A DMARC failure report includes the following ARF header fields,
with the indicated normative requirement levels:

 * Identity-Alignment (**REQUIRED**; defined below)

 * Delivery-Result (**OPTIONAL**)

 * DKIM-Domain, DKIM-Identity, DKIM-Selector (**REQUIRED** for DKIM failures of an aligned identifier)

 * DKIM-Canonicalized-Header, DKIM-Canonicalized-Body (**OPTIONAL** if reporting a DKIM failure)

 * SPF-DNS (**REQUIRED** for SPF failure of an aligned identifier)

2. The "Identity-Alignment" field is defined to contain a comma-
separated list of authentication mechanism names that failed to authenticate an
aligned identity, or the keyword "none" if none did.  ABNF:

``` ABNF
id-align     = "Identity-Alignment:" [CFWS]
                 ( "none" /
                   dmarc-method *( [CFWS] "," [CFWS] dmarc-method ) )
                 [CFWS]

dmarc-method = ( "dkim" / "spf" )
                 ; each may appear at most once in an id-align
```

3. Authentication Failure Type "dmarc" is defined, which is to be
used when a failure report is generated because some or all of
the authentication mechanisms failed to produce aligned
identifiers.  Note that a failure report generator **MAY** also
independently produce an ARF message for any or all of the
underlying authentication methods.

# Verifying External Destinations {#verifying-external-destinations}

It is possible to specify destinations for failure reports that are
outside of the Organizational Domain of the DMARC Policy Record that
was requesting the reports.  These destinations are
commonly referred to as "external destinations" and may represent a
different domain controlled by the same organization, a contracted
report processing service, or some other arrangement.

Without this check, a bad actor could publish a DMARC Policy Record
that requests that failure reports be sent to an external
destination, then deliberately send messages that will generate
failure reports as a form of abuse.  Or, a Domain Owner could
incorrectly publish a DMARC Policy Record with an external destination for
failure reports, forcing the external destination to deal with
unwanted messages and potential privacy issues.

Therefore, in case of external destinations, a Mail Receiver who 
generates failure reports **MUST** use the Verifying External Destinations 
procedure described in [@!I-D.ietf-dmarc-aggregate-reporting, section 3], 
substituting the "ruf" tag where the "rua" tag appears in that procedure.`


## Transport {#transport}

Email streams carrying DMARC failure reports **SHOULD** be DMARC 
aligned.

Reporters **MAY** rate limit the number of failure reports sent
to any recipient to avoid overloading recipient systems.
Unaligned reports may in turn produce subsequent failure reports that could
cause mail loops.

# IANA Considerations {#iana-considerations}

## Feedback Report Header Fields Registry Update

IANA is requested to change the  "Identity-Alignment" entry in the "Feedback Report Header Fields"
registry to refer to this document.

# Privacy Considerations {#privacy-considerations}

This section discusses issues specific to private data that
may be included in the DMARC reporting functions.

## Data Exposure Considerations {#data-exposure-considerations}

Failed-message reporting provides message-specific details pertaining
to authentication failures.  Individual reports can contain message
content as well as trace header fields.  Domain Owners are able to
analyze individual reports and attempt to determine root causes of
authentication mechanism failures, gain insight into
misconfigurations or other problems with email and network
infrastructure, or inspect messages for insight into abusive
practices.

These reports may expose sender and recipient identifiers (e.g.,
RFC5322.From addresses), and although the [@!RFC6591] format used for
failed-message reporting supports redaction, failed-message reporting
is capable of exposing the entire message to the Report Consumer.

Domain Owners requesting reports will receive information about mail
claiming to be from them, which includes mail that was not, in fact,
from them.  Information about the final destination of mail where it
might otherwise be obscured by intermediate systems will therefore be
exposed.

When message-forwarding arrangements exist, Domain Owners requesting
reports will also receive information about mail forwarded to domains
that were not originally part of their messages' recipient lists.
This means that destination domains previously unknown to the Domain
Owner may now become visible.

## Report Recipients {#report-recipients}

A DMARC Policy Record can specify that reports should be sent to an
intermediary operating on behalf of the Domain Owner.  This is done
when the Domain Owner contracts with an entity to monitor mail
streams for abuse and performance issues.  Receipt by third parties
of such data may or may not be permitted by the Mail Receiver's
privacy policy, terms of use, or other similar governing document.
Domain Owners and Mail Receivers should both review and understand if
their own internal policies constrain the use and transmission of
DMARC reporting.

Some potential exists for report recipients to perform traffic
analysis, making it possible to obtain metadata about the Receiver's
traffic.  In addition to verifying compliance with policies,
Receivers need to consider that before sending reports to a third
party.


# Security Considerations {#security-considerations}

While reviewing this document and its Security Considerations, it is ideal
that the reader would also review Privacy Considerations above, as well as
the Privacy Considerations and Security Considerations in section
[@I-D.ietf-dmarc-dmarcbis, 9] and [@I-D.ietf-dmarc-dmarcbis, 10] of
[@I-D.ietf-dmarc-dmarcbis].

In addition, note that Organizational Domains are only an approximation
to actual domain ownership.  Therefore, reports may be sent to someone
unrelated to the actual sender or Domain Owner.  That makes considerations
in (#data-exposure-considerations) all the more relevant.
