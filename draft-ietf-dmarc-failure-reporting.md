.# Abstract

Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting, and Conformance
(DMARC) is a mechanism by which a Domain Owner can request
feedback about email messages using their domain in the From: address
field.  This document describes "failure reports", or "failed message
reports", which provide details about individual messages that failed
to authenticate according to the DMARC mechanism.

# Introduction {#introduction}

RFC EDITOR: PLEASE REMOVE THE FOLLOWING PARAGRAPH BEFORE PUBLISHING:
The source for this draft is maintained in GitHub at:
https://github.com/ietf-wg-dmarc/draft-ietf-dmarc-failure-reporting

Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting, and Conformance (DMARC) 
[@!I-D.ietf-dmarc-dmarcbis] is a mechanism by which a mail-originating 
organization can express domain-level policies and preferences for 
message validation, disposition, and reporting, that can be used by a 
mail-receiving organization to improve mail handling. This document 
focuses on one type of reporting that can be requested under DMARC.

Failure reports provide detailed information about the failure of a 
single message, or a group of similar messages failing for the same 
reason. Their purpose is twofold.  On the one hand they are meant to 
aid in cases where a Domain Owner wishes to determine the cause of 
failures that were part of aggregate reports (see 
[@!I-D.ietf-dmarc-aggregate-reporting]).  On the other hand, they can 
allow the Domain Owner to quickly identify and address harmful 
messages involving direct domain abuse.  It is important to note that 
these reports can contain the header fields or sometimes the entire 
content of a failed message, which may contain personally identifiable 
information (PII). The potential disclosure of PII should be considered 
when deciding whether to request failure reports as a Domain Owner, or 
what information to include or redact in failure reports when creating 
them as a Mail Receiver, or whether to create failure reports at all; 
see (#privacy-considerations).

## Terminology {#terminology}

There are a number of terms defined in
[@!I-D.ietf-dmarc-dmarcbis, section 3.2]
that are used within this document.  Understanding those 
definitions will aid in reading this document.

The format of DMARC failure reports is derived from Authentication 
Failure Reporting Using the Abuse Reporting Format ([@!RFC6591]) and 
the terms defined there are used here.

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL
NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED",
"MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as
described in BCP 14 [@!RFC2119] [@!RFC8174] when, and only when, they
appear in all capitals, as shown here.

## Document Status

This document, in part, along with DMARCbis [@!I-D.ietf-dmarc-dmarcbis]
DMARCbis Aggregate Reporting [@!I-D.ietf-dmarc-aggregate-reporting],
obsoletes and replaces [@RFC7489].

# DMARC Failure Reports {#failure-reports}

Besides the header fields or the entire contents of a failed message, failure 
reports supply details about transmission and DMARC authentication, 
which may aid the Domain Owner in determining the cause of an authentication failure.

Failure reports are normally generated and sent almost immediately 
after the Mail Receiver detects a DMARC failure.  Rather than waiting 
for an aggregate report, these reports are useful for quickly notifying 
the Domain Owners when there is an authentication failure. Failure 
reports also provide more information about the failed message than is 
available in an aggregate report.  This allows the failure report 
consumer to better determine whether the failure is of a message that 
the domain owner intended to authenticate or one for which use of its 
domain was not authorized.

These reports should include as much of the message header fields and body as
possible, consistent with the reporting party's privacy policies, to
enable the Domain Owner to diagnose the authentication failure.

When a Domain Owner requests failure reports for the purpose of
forensic analysis, and the Mail Receiver is willing to provide such
reports, the Mail Receiver generates and sends a message using the
format described in [@!RFC6591]; this document updates that reporting
format, as described in (#reporting-format-update).

The destination(s) to which failure reports are sent, and options for when
they will be sent, are defined by the "ruf" and "fo" tags as defined
in [@!I-D.ietf-dmarc-dmarcbis, section 4.7].

When multiple URIs are provided to receive failure reports, the
report generator **MUST** make an attempt to deliver to each of them.
External destinations **MUST** be verified, see (#verifying-external-destinations).
Report generators **MUST NOT** consider "ruf" tags in DMARC Policy Records having a "psd=y"
tag, unless there are specific agreements between the interested parties.

Report generators **MUST** ensure not to flood report consumers with
excessive reports, which would allow denial of service,
see (#dos-attacks)

# Other Failure Reports {#other-reports}

This document describes only DMARC failure reports. DKIM failure 
reports and SPF failure reports are described in [@!RFC6591].  A Mail 
Receiver generating DMARC failure reports **MAY** issue failure reports 
specific to the failed authentication mechanism instead of, or in 
addition to, DMARC failure reports, based on its own policy, the 
failure in question, and the content of the "fo" tag in the retrieved 
DMARC Policy Record.

Note that DKIM failure reports and SPF failure reports can also be 
requested using the methods described in [@RFC6651] and [@RFC6652], 
respectively.  Report Generators are free to follow any of the 
specifications.


# Reporting Format Update {#reporting-format-update}

Operators implementing this specification also implement an augmented
version of [@!RFC6591] as follows:

1. A DMARC failure report includes the following ARF header fields,
with the indicated normative requirement levels:

 * Identity-Alignment (**REQUIRED**; defined below)

 * Delivery-Result (**OPTIONAL**)

 * DKIM-Domain, DKIM-Identity, DKIM-Selector (**REQUIRED** for DKIM failures of an aligned identifier)

 * DKIM-Canonicalized-Header, DKIM-Canonicalized-Body (**OPTIONAL** if reporting a DKIM failure)

 * SPF-DNS (**REQUIRED** for SPF failure of an aligned identifier)

2. The "Identity-Alignment" field is defined to contain a comma-
separated list of authentication mechanism names that failed to authenticate an
aligned identity, or the keyword "none" if none did.  ABNF ([@!RFC5234]):

``` ABNF
id-align     = "Identity-Alignment:" [CFWS]
                 ( "none" /
                   dmarc-method *( [CFWS] "," [CFWS] dmarc-method ) )
                 [CFWS]

dmarc-method = ( "dkim" / "spf" )
                 ; each may appear at most once in an id-align
```

3. Authentication Failure Type "dmarc" is defined for the Auth-Failure 
field, which is to be used when a failure report is generated because 
some or all of the authentication mechanisms failed to produce aligned 
identifiers.  Note that a failure report generator **MAY** also 
independently produce an ARF message for any or all of the underlying 
authentication methods.

# Verifying External Destinations {#verifying-external-destinations}

It is possible to specify destinations for failure reports that are
outside of the Organizational Domain of the DMARC Policy Record that
was requesting the reports.  These destinations are
commonly referred to as "external destinations" and may represent a
different domain controlled by the same organization, a contracted
report processing service, or some other arrangement.

In case of external destinations, a Mail Receiver who 
generates failure reports **MUST** use the Verifying External Destinations 
procedure described in [@!I-D.ietf-dmarc-aggregate-reporting, section 4], 
substituting the "ruf" tag where the "rua" tag appears in that procedure.

This prevents a bad actor from publishing a DMARC Policy Record 
requesting failure reports to an external destination, and
then deliberately sending messages that will generate failure reports 
as a form of abuse. It also prevents a Domain Owner from unilaterally 
publishing a DMARC Policy Record with an external destination for 
failure reports, forcing the external destination to deal with unwanted 
messages and potential privacy issues.

## Transport {#transport}

Email streams carrying DMARC failure reports **SHOULD** be DMARC 
aligned.

Reporters **MAY** rate limit the number of failure reports sent
to any recipient to avoid overloading recipient systems.
Unaligned reports may in turn produce subsequent failure reports that could
cause mail loops.

# IANA Considerations {#iana-considerations}

## Feedback Report Header Fields Registry Update

IANA is requested to change the  "Identity-Alignment" entry in the 
"Feedback Report Header Fields" registry, which is part of the 
"Messaging Abuse Reporting Format (MARF) Parameters" registry group, to 
refer to this document.


# Privacy Considerations {#privacy-considerations}

The generation and transmission of DMARC failure reports raise 
significant privacy concerns that must be carefully considered before 
deployment.

Given these factors, many large-scale providers limit or entirely 
disable the generation of failure reports, preferring to rely on 
aggregate reports, which provide statistical visibility without 
exposing sensitive content. Operators that choose to enable failure 
reporting are strongly encouraged to:

* Limit the scope and duration of use to targeted diagnostic activities.
* Ensure that reporting URIs are carefully controlled and validated.
* Apply minimization techniques, such as redaction of message bodies 
  and header fields, to reduce sensitive data exposure.
* Always transmit reports over secure channels.

In summary, while DMARC failure reports can offer diagnostic value, the 
associated privacy concerns have led many operators to restrict their 
use.  Aggregate reports remain the recommended mechanism for gaining 
visibility into authentication results while preserving the 
confidentiality of end-user communications.

Particular privacy-specific issues are explored below.

## Data Exposure Considerations

Failure reports may include PII and non-public information (NPI) from 
messages that fail to authenticate, since these reports may contain 
message content as well as trace header fields. These reports may 
expose sender and recipient identifiers (e.g., RFC5322.From addresses), 
and although the [@!RFC5965] format used for failed-message reporting 
supports redaction ([@!RFC6590]), failed-message reporting is capable of 
exposing the entire message to the Report Consumer.  They may also 
expose PII, sensitive business data, or other confidential 
communications to unintended recipients. Such exposure can create 
regulatory, legal, and operational risks for both senders and 
receivers.  Examples include product launches, termination notices for 
employees, or calendar data. Even innocuous-seeming failures (such as 
malformed or "broken" calendar invitations) can result in the leakage 
of private communications.

Domain Owners requesting reports will receive information about mail 
using their domain, but which they did not actually cause to be sent. 
This might provide valuable insight into content used in abusive 
messages, but it might also expose PII or NPI from legitimate messages 
mistakenly or accidentally failing authentication.

Information about the final destination of mail, where it might 
otherwise be obscured by intermediate systems, may be exposed through a 
failure report. A commonly cited example is exposure of members of 
mailing lists when one list member sends messages to the list, and 
failure reports are generated when that message is delivered to other 
list members. Those failure reports would be sent to the Domain Owner 
of the list member posting the message, or their delegated Report 
Consumer(s).

Similarly, when message forwarding arrangements exist, Domain Owners 
requesting reports may receive information about mail forwarded to 
domains that were not originally part of their messages' recipient 
list. This means that destinations previously unknown to the Domain 
Owner may now become visible.

## Report Recipients

A DMARC Policy Record can specify that reports should be sent to a 
Report Consumer operating on behalf of the Domain Owner. This might be 
done when the Domain Owner sends reports to an entity to monitor mail 
streams for deliverability, performance issues, or abuse. Receipt of 
such data by third parties may or may not be permitted by the Mail 
Receiver's privacy policy, terms of use, et cetera. Domain Owners and 
Mail Receivers should both review and understand whether their own 
internal policies constrain the use and transmission of DMARC 
reporting.

Some potential exists for Report Consumers to perform traffic analysis, 
making it possible to obtain metadata about the Mail Receiver's 
traffic. In addition to verifying compliance with policies, Mail 
Receivers need to consider that before sending reports to a third 
party.  On the other hand, a Domain Owner may publish a destination 
address that appears to be an Internal Report Consumer but is actually 
a forwarding address; in this case, the final destination of a report 
is not guaranteed.

## Additional Damage

The risks associated with failure reports are compounded by volume and 
content distribution concerns. Partially or unredacted reports may 
propagate large amounts of spam, phishing, or malware content, all of 
which may require special handling by Report Consumers or other 
recipients to avoid incidents. This underscores the need to avoid 
misconfiguration of the destinations in the "ruf" reporting URIs, and 
the suggestions for redaction in this document, for example using the 
method described in [@!RFC6590]. All of these concerns are 
heightened for high-volume domains. To mitigate such concerns, the 
following steps should be considered:

By report generators:

* defang URIs by substituting hxxp for http;
* remove malicious attachments such as word documents or pdfs.

By report consumers:

* isolate report streams from other mail streams;
* use sandboxes in evaluating failure reports;
* use network segmentation;
* limit access to failure reports to authorized individuals with 
  appropriate security training.


# Security Considerations {#security-considerations}

While reviewing this document and its Security Considerations, the
reader should also review the Privacy Considerations above, as well as
the Privacy Considerations and Security Considerations in sections
[@!I-D.ietf-dmarc-dmarcbis, 10] and [@!I-D.ietf-dmarc-dmarcbis, 11] of
[@!I-D.ietf-dmarc-dmarcbis]; and in sections
[@!I-D.ietf-dmarc-aggregate-reporting, 7] and
[@!I-D.ietf-dmarc-aggregate-reporting, 8] of
[@!I-D.ietf-dmarc-aggregate-reporting].

## Denial of Service {#dos-attacks}

Failure reports represent a possible denial-of-service attack that could be
perpetrated by an attacker who sends numerous messages purporting to
be from the intended victim Domain Owner but which fail both SPF and
DKIM; this would cause participating Mail Receivers to send failure
reports to the Domain Owner or its delegate(s), potentially in large
numbers.
Accordingly, participating Mail Receivers are encouraged to
aggregate these reports as much as is practical, using the Incidents
field of the Abuse Reporting Format [@!RFC5965].
Indeed, the aim is not to count each and every failure, but rather to
report different failure conditions.
Various pruning techniques are possible, including the following:

* store reports for a period of time before sending them, allowing
detection, collection, and consolidation of like incidents;

* apply rate limiting, such as a maximum number of reports per
minute that will be generated (and the remainder discarded.)

[ Message body was here ]
--=_mime_boundary_--
```

The Source-Port field definition is given by [@!RFC6692]

In the final MIME entity, the local-parts of To and From addresses are 
reported unredacted.  Since we know that the local parts are PII, we 
can reduce the privacy risk by redacting them.  In the example, the 
report generator could have replaced "users" with "lRLxexey" and 
"author" with "RT47aVey" throughout the entity.

If the body of the message is not included, the last MIME entity
would have "Content-Type: text/rfc822-headers" instead of message/rfc822.
